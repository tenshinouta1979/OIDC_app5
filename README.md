# OIDC Silent Authentication Flow: App1 (IdP) & App2 (Relying Party)

This document summarizes the implementation and debugging process for establishing a secure OpenID Connect (OIDC) silent authentication flow between two ASP.NET Core applications:

* **App1 (Identity Provider - IdP):** Hosts user login and issues ID Tokens.
* **App2 (Relying Party - RP):** Is embedded within an iframe on App1's page and uses silent authentication to obtain an ID Token from App1, validate it, and establish its own session.

## Overall Goal

To achieve a fully functional OIDC silent authentication setup where:

* Users can **log in** to App1.
* **App2 is authenticated and visible** within an iframe on App1's page.
* Authentication state **persists** across browser refreshes (F5) for App1.
* Users can **log out** from App1, which also affects App2's session.

## Initial Setup (Implicitly Programmed)

We began with a foundational ASP.NET Core Razor Pages structure for both applications:

* **App1:**
    * Simple login functionality.
    * `Index.cshtml` to serve as the main page and host the iframe.
    * Basic OIDC-like endpoints: `/connect/authorize`, `/.well-known/openid-configuration`, and `/jwks`.
* **App2:**
    * A simple `Index.cshtml` to display authentication status.
    * `silent-refresh.cshtml` to handle the silent OIDC callback.
    * An `AuthController` to validate incoming tokens and establish App2's own session.
* `appsettings.json` files in both applications for configuring cross-application origins (e.g., `App1Origin`, `App2Origin`).

## The Intended OIDC Silent Authentication Flow (Conceptual)

This describes the desired step-by-step process for a successful silent authentication:

1.  **User Logs into App1:** The user authenticates directly with App1 (the IdP). App1 sets an authentication cookie for its domain.
2.  **App1 Loads App2 Iframe:** App1's `Index.cshtml` page loads and includes a primary `<iframe>` whose `src` points to App2's main page (`https://localhost:7084/`). This iframe is initially hidden.
3.  **App1 Initiates Silent OIDC:** Once the visible App2 iframe loads, App1's JavaScript dynamically creates a **second, hidden** `<iframe>`. The `src` of this hidden iframe points to App1's OIDC `authorize` endpoint (`https://localhost:7188/connect/authorize`) with specific parameters (`prompt=none`, `redirect_uri` set to `https://localhost:7084/silent-refresh`, `client_id`, `response_type`, `scope`, `nonce`, `state`).
4.  **Silent Authentication (Hidden Iframe):**
    * The hidden iframe loads App1's `authorize` endpoint.
    * Because `prompt=none` and the user is already authenticated with App1 (from step 1), App1 silently issues an ID Token and an Access Token.
    * App1 then redirects the hidden iframe to `https://localhost:7084/silent-refresh`, appending the newly issued tokens in the URL fragment (e.g., `#id_token=...&access_token=...`).
5.  **App2's `silent-refresh` Processes Tokens:** The JavaScript code within `App2/Pages/silent-refresh.cshtml` executes, reads the tokens directly from its own URL fragment (`window.location.hash`).
6.  **`postMessage` to Parent:** `silent-refresh.cshtml` uses `window.parent.postMessage()` to securely send the extracted ID Token and Access Token back to App1's main page (the parent window).
7.  **App1 Receives Tokens:** App1's `Index.cshtml` JavaScript (which is listening for messages via `window.addEventListener('message')`) receives these tokens from the `silent-refresh` iframe.
8.  **App1 `postMessage` to Visible App2 Iframe:** App1's JavaScript then `postMessage()`es the received tokens to the *visible* App2 iframe (the one loading `https://localhost:7084/`).
9.  **App2's Main Page Validates Tokens:** The JavaScript on `App2/Pages/Index.cshtml` (running within the visible iframe) receives the tokens via `postMessage()`. It then makes an AJAX `POST` request to its own backend endpoint (`/api/auth/validate-oidc-token`), sending the ID Token in the request body.
10. **App2 Backend Validates and Authenticates:**
    * App2's `AuthController` receives the ID Token in the request body.
    * It manually validates the ID Token's signature, issuer, and audience using `JwtSecurityTokenHandler.ValidateToken` and pre-configured `TokenValidationParameters`.
    * If the token is valid, App2's backend signs in the user using its own cookie authentication scheme (`HttpContext.SignInAsync`), establishing a separate session for App2's domain.
    * It returns a success response to the frontend, including user claims (e.g., `userId`, `projectId`).
11. **App2 UI Updates:** App2's frontend JavaScript receives the success response and dynamically updates its UI to display authenticated content. The iframe is made visible.

## Debugging Journey: Problems, Solutions, and Deviations

Our path to a working solution involved addressing several issues, often requiring iterative logging and refinement.

### 1. Initial Iframe Display Issues

* **Symptom:** App2's content was not showing in the iframe, sometimes appearing as a blank or red screen, with no console logs originating from App2.
* **Diagnosis:** This was primarily due to browser security policies, specifically `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`, which restrict cross-origin iframe embedding.
* **Fix:**
    * Added middleware to `App2/Program.cs` to explicitly **remove the `X-Frame-Options` header**.
    * Configured `Content-Security-Policy` in `App2/Program.cs` to include `frame-ancestors https://localhost:7188;`, allowing embedding from App1's origin.
    * **Refinement:** Initially, the CSP was too restrictive for App2's own resources (like Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts). We had to broaden `default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, etc., to `*` or include `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` for development purposes to ensure App2's UI rendered correctly within the iframe.

### 2. `test.html` 404 Not Found

* **Symptom:** When attempting to load a simple static `test.html` file directly in the iframe (for isolated testing), the browser returned a `404 Not Found`.
* **Diagnosis:** The `test.html` file was placed in the root project directory of App2, not within the `wwwroot` folder, which is where ASP.NET Core's static file serving middleware (`app.UseStaticFiles()`) expects to find static assets.
* **Fix:** Instructed to **move `test.html` into `App2/wwwroot/`**.

### 3. `postMessage` Data `null` (App1 Console)

* **Symptom:** App1's console showed `App1: Received message from origin: https://localhost:7084 with data: {id_token: null, access_token: null, error: null}`. This meant App2's `silent-refresh` page was sending empty data.
* **Diagnosis:** This was a consequence of the next, more fundamental problem.

### 4. `Invalid client_id` or `redirect_uri` (App1 Server Console)

* **Symptom:** App1's server logs displayed `Invalid client_id ('app2_client') or redirect_uri ('https://localhost:7084/silent-refresh')`. This prevented App1 from issuing tokens.
* **Diagnosis:** The `app2Origin` variable in `App1/Program.cs` was not correctly populated from `appsettings.json` at the time the `/connect/authorize` endpoint's validation logic was executed. This was a **variable scope and initialization timing issue**.
* **Fix:** **Moved the retrieval of `app1Origin` and `app2Origin` from `IConfiguration` to *after* `app.Build()` but *before* any `app.MapGet` endpoint definitions** that used them in `App1/Program.cs`. Added specific logging to confirm the values were being read correctly.

### 5. `ID Token validation failed: The input does not contain any JSON tokens.` (App2 Server Console)

* **Symptom:** App2's backend `AuthController` received the token string, but the `HttpContext.AuthenticateAsync` call failed with this error.
* **Diagnosis:** The `[FromBody]` attribute on the `ValidateOidcToken` method consumed the request body, leaving nothing for the default `JwtBearer` authentication middleware (which typically expects tokens in `Authorization` headers) to parse.
* **Fix:** Modified `App2/Controllers/AuthController.cs` to **manually validate** the `idToken` from the `request.IdToken` property using `JwtSecurityTokenHandler.ValidateToken` and the injected `TokenValidationParameters`.

### 6. `ID Token validation failed: Unknown reason` (App2 Server Console)

* **Symptom:** After the manual validation fix, the error became more generic.
* **Diagnosis:** The `SecurityTokenValidationException` was being caught, but its specific message wasn't being fully logged.
* **Fix:** Enhanced the `catch (SecurityTokenValidationException stvex)` block in `App2/Controllers/AuthController.cs` to explicitly log `stvex.Message`, which then provided more precise details about token validation failures (e.g., issuer mismatch, signature validation failure). This was often resolved by ensuring all `jwtSecret` strings and `App1Origin` URLs were **perfectly identical** across all relevant configuration files and code.

### 7. Logout `400 Bad Request`

* **Symptom:** Clicking the logout button resulted in a `400 Bad Request`.
* **Diagnosis (Initial):** Suspected missing anti-forgery token.
* **Fix (Attempt 1):** Added `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()` to the logout form in `App1/Pages/Index.cshtml`.
* **Result:** Still `400`, with a new error: `The provided antiforgery token was meant for a different claims-based user`.
* **Diagnosis (Refined):** This specific error indicated that ASP.NET Core's anti-forgery validation was failing due to a user context mismatch, common for logout.
* **Fix (Attempt 2):** Added `[IgnoreAntiforgeryToken]` attribute to `OnPostLogoutAsync` in `App1/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs`.
* **Result:** Still `400`, but the specific anti-forgery error message disappeared from logs. This implied custom anti-forgery middleware was interfering.
* **Fix (Attempt 3):** **Removed the custom anti-forgery middleware** from `App1/Program.cs`, relying solely on Razor Pages' built-in anti-forgery and the `[IgnoreAntiforgeryToken]` attribute.
* **Result:** Still `400`, and `OnPostLogoutAsync` logs were not appearing. This indicated the POST request wasn't even hitting the handler.
* **Fix (Final for Logout):** Changed the logout button to a simple **GET link** (`<a href="?handler=Logout">`) in `App1/Pages/Index.cshtml` and changed the corresponding handler method in `App1/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs` to `OnGetLogoutAsync`. This successfully allowed the logout to complete by using a GET request, which does not require anti-forgery tokens by default.

### 8. Refresh (F5) Logs Out (Session Persistence)

* **Symptom:** After logging in, refreshing the browser (F5) redirects back to the login page.
* **Diagnosis:** Authentication cookies are not persisting across application restarts (common in development environments where Data Protection keys are lost in memory).
* **Fix (Attempt 1):** Configured `builder.Services.AddDataProtection().PersistKeysToFileSystem(...)` in `App1/Program.cs` to store cookie encryption keys to the file system. Also ensured `IsPersistent = true` and `ExpiresUtc` were set for the authentication cookie in `LoginModel.OnPostAsync`.
* **Current Status:** This issue is still being investigated. While `DataProtection` is configured and logging indicates keys are being written, the cookie isn't being recognized on subsequent requests after a restart. Further investigation is needed into cookie domain/path settings, or potential browser-specific caching behaviors.
