# OIDC Silent Authentication Flow: App1 (IdP) & App2 (Relying Party)

This document summarizes the implementation and debugging process for establishing a secure OpenID Connect (OIDC) silent authentication flow between two ASP.NET Core applications:

* **App1 (Identity Provider - IdP):** Hosts user login and issues ID Tokens.
* **App2 (Relying Party - RP):** Is embedded within an iframe on App1's page and uses silent authentication to obtain an ID Token from App1, validate it, and establish its own session.

## Overall Goal

To achieve a fully functional OIDC silent authentication setup where:

* Users can **log in** to App1.
* **App2 is authenticated and visible** within an iframe on App1's page.
* Authentication state **persists** across browser refreshes (F5) for App1.
* Users can **log out** from App1, which also affects App2's session.

## Initial Setup (Implicitly Programmed)

We began with a foundational ASP.NET Core Razor Pages structure for both applications:

* **App1:**
    * Simple login functionality.
    * `Index.cshtml` to serve as the main page and host the iframe.
    * Basic OIDC-like endpoints: `/connect/authorize`, `/.well-known/openid-configuration`, and `/jwks`.
* **App2:**
    * A simple `Index.cshtml` to display authentication status.
    * `silent-refresh.cshtml` to handle the silent OIDC callback.
    * An `AuthController` to validate incoming tokens and establish App2's own session.
* `appsettings.json` files in both applications for configuring cross-application origins (e.g., `App1Origin`, `App2Origin`).

## The Intended OIDC Silent Authentication Flow (Conceptual)

This describes the desired step-by-step process for a successful silent authentication:

1.  **User Logs into App1:** The user authenticates directly with App1 (the IdP). App1 sets an authentication cookie for its domain.
2.  **App1 Loads App2 Iframe:** App1's `Index.cshtml` page loads and includes a primary `<iframe>` whose `src` points to App2's main page (`https://localhost:7084/`). This iframe is initially hidden.
3.  **App1 Initiates Silent OIDC:** Once the visible App2 iframe loads, App1's JavaScript dynamically creates a **second, hidden** `<iframe>`. The `src` of this hidden iframe points to App1's OIDC `authorize` endpoint (`https://localhost:7188/connect/authorize`) with specific parameters (`prompt=none`, `redirect_uri` set to `https://localhost:7084/silent-refresh`, `client_id`, `response_type`, `scope`, `nonce`, `state`).
4.  **Silent Authentication (Hidden Iframe):**
    * The hidden iframe loads App1's `authorize` endpoint.
    * Because `prompt=none` and the user is already authenticated with App1 (from step 1), App1 silently issues an ID Token and an Access Token.
    * App1 then redirects the hidden iframe to `https://localhost:7084/silent-refresh`, appending the newly issued tokens in the URL fragment (e.g., `#id_token=...&access_token=...`).
5.  **App2's `silent-refresh` Processes Tokens:** The JavaScript code within `App2/Pages/silent-refresh.cshtml` executes, reads the tokens directly from its own URL fragment (`window.location.hash`).
6.  **`postMessage` to Parent:** `silent-refresh.cshtml` uses `window.parent.postMessage()` to securely send the extracted ID Token and Access Token back to App1's main page (the parent window).
7.  **App1 Receives Tokens:** App1's `Index.cshtml` JavaScript (which is listening for messages via `window.addEventListener('message')`) receives these tokens from the `silent-refresh` iframe.
8.  **App1 `postMessage` to Visible App2 Iframe:** App1's JavaScript then `postMessage()`es the received tokens to the *visible* App2 iframe (the one loading `https://localhost:7084/`).
9.  **App2's Main Page Validates Tokens:** The JavaScript on `App2/Pages/Index.cshtml` (running within the visible iframe) receives the tokens via `postMessage()`. It then makes an AJAX `POST` request to its own backend endpoint (`/api/auth/validate-oidc-token`), sending the ID Token in the request body.
10. **App2 Backend Validates and Authenticates:**
    * App2's `AuthController` receives the ID Token in the request body.
    * It manually validates the ID Token's signature, issuer, and audience using `JwtSecurityTokenHandler.ValidateToken` and pre-configured `TokenValidationParameters`.
    * If the token is valid, App2's backend signs in the user using its own cookie authentication scheme (`HttpContext.SignInAsync`), establishing a separate session for App2's domain.
    * It returns a success response to the frontend, including user claims (e.g., `userId`, `projectId`).
11. **App2 UI Updates:** App2's frontend JavaScript receives the success response and dynamically updates its UI to display authenticated content. The iframe is made visible.

## Debugging Journey: Problems, Solutions, and Deviations

Our path to a working solution involved addressing several issues, often requiring iterative logging and refinement.

### 1. Initial Iframe Display Issues

* **Symptom:** App2's content was not showing in the iframe, sometimes appearing as a blank or red screen, with no console logs originating from App2.
* **Diagnosis:** This was primarily due to browser security policies, specifically `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`, which restrict cross-origin iframe embedding.
* **Fix:**
    * Added middleware to `App2/Program.cs` to explicitly **remove the `X-Frame-Options` header**.
    * Configured `Content-Security-Policy` in `App2/Program.cs` to include `frame-ancestors https://localhost:7188;`, allowing embedding from App1's origin.
    * **Refinement:** Initially, the CSP was too restrictive for App2's own resources (like Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts). We had to broaden `default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, etc., to `*` or include `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` for development purposes to ensure App2's UI rendered correctly within the iframe.

### 2. `test.html` 404 Not Found

* **Symptom:** When attempting to load a simple static `test.html` file directly in the iframe (for isolated testing), the browser returned a `404 Not Found`.
* **Diagnosis:** The `test.html` file was placed in the root project directory of App2, not within the `wwwroot` folder, which is where ASP.NET Core's static file serving middleware (`app.UseStaticFiles()`) expects to find static assets.
* **Fix:** Instructed to **move `test.html` into `App2/wwwroot/`**.

### 3. `postMessage` Data `null` (App1 Console)

* **Symptom:** App1's console showed `App1: Received message from origin: https://localhost:7084 with data: {id_token: null, access_token: null, error: null}`. This meant App2's `silent-refresh` page was sending empty data.
* **Diagnosis:** This was a consequence of the next, more fundamental problem.

### 4. `Invalid client_id` or `redirect_uri` (App1 Server Console)

* **Symptom:** App1's server logs displayed `Invalid client_id ('app2_client') or redirect_uri ('https://localhost:7084/silent-refresh')`. This prevented App1 from issuing tokens.
* **Diagnosis:** The `app2Origin` variable in `App1/Program.cs` was not correctly populated from `appsettings.json` at the time the `/connect/authorize` endpoint's validation logic was executed. This was a **variable scope and initialization timing issue**.
* **Fix:** **Moved the retrieval of `app1Origin` and `app2Origin` from `IConfiguration` to *after* `app.Build()` but *before* any `app.MapGet` endpoint definitions** that used them in `App1/Program.cs`. Added specific logging to confirm the values were being read correctly.

### 5. `ID Token validation failed: The input does not contain any JSON tokens.` (App2 Server Console)

* **Symptom:** App2's backend `AuthController` received the token string, but the `HttpContext.AuthenticateAsync` call failed with this error.
* **Diagnosis:** The `[FromBody]` attribute on the `ValidateOidcToken` method consumed the request body, leaving nothing for the default `JwtBearer` authentication middleware (which typically expects tokens in `Authorization` headers) to parse.
* **Fix:** Modified `App2/Controllers/AuthController.cs` to **manually validate** the `idToken` from the `request.IdToken` property using `JwtSecurityTokenHandler.ValidateToken` and the injected `TokenValidationParameters`.

### 6. `ID Token validation failed: Unknown reason` (App2 Server Console)

* **Symptom:** After the manual validation fix, the error became more generic.
* **Diagnosis:** The `SecurityTokenValidationException` was being caught, but its specific message wasn't being fully logged.
* **Fix:** Enhanced the `catch (SecurityTokenValidationException stvex)` block in `App2/Controllers/AuthController.cs` to explicitly log `stvex.Message`, which then provided more precise details about token validation failures (e.g., issuer mismatch, signature validation failure). This was often resolved by ensuring all `jwtSecret` strings and `App1Origin` URLs were **perfectly identical** across all relevant configuration files and code.

### 7. Logout `400 Bad Request`

* **Symptom:** Clicking the logout button resulted in a `400 Bad Request`.
* **Diagnosis (Initial):** Suspected missing anti-forgery token.
* **Fix (Attempt 1):** Added `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()` to the logout form in `App1/Pages/Index.cshtml`.
* **Result:** Still `400`, with a new error: `The provided antiforgery token was meant for a different claims-based user`.
* **Diagnosis (Refined):** This specific error indicated that ASP.NET Core's anti-forgery validation was failing due to a user context mismatch, common for logout.
* **Fix (Attempt 2):** Added `[IgnoreAntiforgeryToken]` attribute to `OnPostLogoutAsync` in `App1/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs`.
* **Result:** Still `400`, but the specific anti-forgery error message disappeared from logs. This implied custom anti-forgery middleware was interfering.
* **Fix (Attempt 3):** **Removed the custom anti-forgery middleware** from `App1/Program.cs`, relying solely on Razor Pages' built-in anti-forgery and the `[IgnoreAntiforgeryToken]` attribute.
* **Result:** Still `400`, and `OnPostLogoutAsync` logs were not appearing. This indicated the POST request wasn't even hitting the handler.
* **Fix (Final for Logout):** Changed the logout button to a simple **GET link** (`<a href="?handler=Logout">`) in `App1/Pages/Index.cshtml` and changed the corresponding handler method in `App1/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs` to `OnGetLogoutAsync`. This successfully allowed the logout to complete by using a GET request, which does not require anti-forgery tokens by default.

### 8. Refresh (F5) Logs Out (Session Persistence)

* **Symptom:** After logging in, refreshing the browser (F5) redirects back to the login page.
* **Diagnosis:** Authentication cookies are not persisting across application restarts (common in development environments where Data Protection keys are lost in memory).
* **Fix (Attempt 1):** Configured `builder.Services.AddDataProtection().PersistKeysToFileSystem(...)` in `App1/Program.cs` to store cookie encryption keys to the file system. Also ensured `IsPersistent = true` and `ExpiresUtc` were set for the authentication cookie in `LoginModel.OnPostAsync`.
* **Current Status:** This issue is still being investigated. While `DataProtection` is configured and logging indicates keys are being written, the cookie isn't being recognized on subsequent requests after a restart. Further investigation is needed into cookie domain/path settings, or potential browser-specific caching behaviors.

2. Animation Prompt Script
This script describes a series of scenes suitable for generating an animation. Imagine a clean, modern aesthetic with clear labels and smooth transitions.



**Animation Title:** Secure Token Flow: App1 (IdP) & App2 (Iframe)

**Style:** Clean, modern, digital. Use distinct colors for App1 (e.g., blue), App2 (e.g., green), and tokens (e.g., gold for ID Token, silver for Access Token). Actors (User, Browser, Servers) should be clearly labeled icons or simple shapes.

---

**Scene 1: User Login & Initial Setup**
* **Visual:** A user icon sits at a desk with a computer (Browser icon). On the screen, a clean login form for "App1".
* **Action:** User types, clicks "Login". An arrow labeled "Login Request" goes from Browser to a server rack labeled "App1 Backend (IdP)".
* **Transition:** A small, glowing "App1 Auth Cookie" icon appears next to the Browser. The screen changes to "App1 Home" with a placeholder area for App2.

---

**Scene 2: App2 Iframe Loads & Silent Auth Initiates**
* **Visual:** App1 Home is on the Browser screen. The placeholder area for App2 is a hidden, faint box.
* **Action:** A small, transparent iframe (labeled "Hidden Iframe") emerges from App1's browser window. An arrow labeled "OIDC Auth Request (prompt=none)" shoots from this hidden iframe towards "App1 Backend (IdP)". The URL in the hidden iframe's address bar briefly shows `https://localhost:7188/connect/authorize...`.
* **Transition:** Focus shifts to App1 Backend.

---

**Scene 3: IdP Issues Tokens (Silent)**
* **Visual:** Inside "App1 Backend (IdP)", a quick animation of "Cookie Check (OK!)" followed by "Token Generation".
* **Action:** Two distinct, glowing tokens (one gold "ID Token", one silver "Access Token") fly from "App1 Backend (IdP)" towards the "Hidden Iframe". The hidden iframe's URL briefly changes to `https://localhost:7084/silent-refresh#id_token=...`.
* **Transition:** Focus shifts to the "Hidden Iframe".

---

**Scene 4: App2 Silent Refresh & PostMessage**
* **Visual:** The "Hidden Iframe" (now loading `https://localhost:7084/silent-refresh`) is prominent. The gold and silver tokens are inside it.
* **Action:** The tokens are quickly processed by a "JS Parser" animation within the hidden iframe. A new arrow labeled "postMessage (Tokens)" shoots from the "Hidden Iframe" back to the main "App1 Frontend (IdP UI)" window.
* **Transition:** The "Hidden Iframe" quickly fades and disappears.

---

**Scene 5: App1 Passes Tokens to Visible App2 Iframe**
* **Visual:** The main "App1 Frontend (IdP UI)" window is visible, with the gold and silver tokens now present. The primary App2 iframe area is still faint/hidden.
* **Action:** An arrow labeled "postMessage (Tokens)" shoots from "App1 Frontend (IdP UI)" directly into the primary App2 iframe area.
* **Transition:** Focus shifts to the primary App2 iframe area.

---

**Scene 6: App2 Backend Validation & Session Establishment**
* **Visual:** The primary App2 iframe area is now a solid box labeled "App2 Frontend (RP UI)". The gold and silver tokens are inside it.
* **Action:** An arrow labeled "POST /api/auth/validate-oidc-token (JSON Body)" shoots from "App2 Frontend (RP UI)" to "App2 Backend (RP Server)". Inside "App2 Backend (RP Server)", an animation shows "Token Validation (OK!)".
* **Transition:** A small, glowing "App2 Auth Cookie" icon appears next to "App2 Backend (RP Server)". A "Success" message flies back to "App2 Frontend (RP UI)".

---

**Scene 7: App2 UI Updates & Visibility**
* **Visual:** The "App2 Frontend (RP UI)" box is now fully vibrant and visible on the Browser screen, displaying "Authenticated Content" (e.g., "Welcome User!", "Project ID: XYZ").
* **Action:** The "App2 Auth Cookie" icon moves from "App2 Backend (RP Server)" to sit next to the "Browser" (representing it's now a browser cookie).
* **Transition:** Smooth fade out.
